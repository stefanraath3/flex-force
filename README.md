# Job Board

A modern job board application built with React and TypeScript. This project serves as an exploration of the Figma Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration, developed following the Designership course curriculum.

The application features a clean, responsive interface for managing job postings and applicant tracking, with a focus on implementing design systems and component architecture learned through the Designership program.

## About

This project was created as a learning exercise to experiment with Figma MCP capabilities and apply design system principles from the [Designership](https://designership.com) course. It demonstrates practical implementation of modern React patterns, TypeScript, and design-to-code workflows.
